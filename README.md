# üìå Project Overview

## üéØ Project Objectives

This project uses the AdventureWorks dataset available on BigQuery to explore the activities of a simulated multinational bicycle manufacturer and distributor through SQL queries. Its objective is to showcase SQL analytics skills by analyzing key business factors - such as sales performance, year-over-year growth, territory rankings, discount costs, customer retention, stock level trends, and pending orders - in order to extract meaningful insights that reflect real-world business challenges.

## ‚ùì Core Questions

The analysis focuses on key questions:

- **Sales performance** ‚Äì How do sales, order volumes, and growth trends vary by product subcategory and territory?
- **Pricing & promotions** ‚Äì What is the financial impact of seasonal discounts on different product subcategories?
- **Customer dynamics** ‚Äì What is the retention rate of customers over time, and how do shipment outcomes influence it?
- **Inventory & operations** ‚Äì How do stock levels evolve month by month, what is the ratio of stock to sales, and how does it affect efficiency?
- **Order management** ‚Äì How many orders remain pending, and what is their associated value?

## üë• Target audience

- Sales & Marketing Team
- Operations Team
- Analytics & Data Team
- Business Strategy & Management Team
- Finance Team

# üß© Analysis Approach

## üîç Sales values, order quantities, and item quantities by subcategory in the last 12 months

This analysis aims to evaluate overall sales performance at the product subcategory level. The result reveals sales trends over the month and the contribution of each product sub-group to revenue and demand in the recent year.

üìú **Query**

```sql
SELECT
  FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', DATE(sod.ModifiedDate)) AS period
  , sub.Name AS subcat
  , SUM(sod.OrderQty) AS item_qty
  , SUM(sod.LineTotal) AS total_sales
  , COUNT(DISTINCT sod.SalesOrderID) AS order_count
FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail` AS sod
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.Product` AS pro
  ON sod.ProductID = pro.ProductID
LEFT JOIN `adventureworks2019.Production.ProductSubcategory` AS sub
  ON CAST(pro.ProductSubcategoryID AS INT64) = sub.ProductSubcategoryID
WHERE DATE(sod.ModifiedDate) >= DATE_SUB((SELECT DATE(MAX(ModifiedDate)) 
                                          FROM `adventureworks2019.Sales.SalesOrderDetail`), INTERVAL 12 MONTH)
GROUP BY period, subcat
ORDER BY subcat, period DESC;
```
